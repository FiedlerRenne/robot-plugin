<div>
    Directory in which the test-results (log.html, report.html, output.xml, (possibly) debug and summary) will
    be created.
    Default is the the workspace.
    Note that if you are using a custom workspace, every run of a job has the same workspace.
    So the current outputs always overwrites the old one.
